## Go Links For Everyone

Google's internal system of Go Links has proven itself an incredibly effective way to organize information for sharing and for self-reference, because it defines a singular namespace with an easy interface.

In order to replicate this effective system for personal use, I bought Grady.In, and set up this system.  Anyone can easily register a link by going to grady.in/register/the-link-name-you-want

## Architechure

Grady.In uses a serverless architechure to perform updates, and uses github pages for hosting.
